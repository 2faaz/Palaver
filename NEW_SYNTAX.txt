Here the syntax of dictionary files will be finalized. For the most
part, not much has to change, the syntax of dictionary files already
makes them able to match many different sentences with little
code. But there are ways it can be improved.

First, It should be known the purpose of this syntax.

The purpose of this syntax is to be as efficient as possible at
extracting meaning from natural language. We are looking for the
semantics of a sentence, not it's syntax.

For the reason above, the first improvement is that all matches done
by the dictionary are case insensitive. I can not think of any time
that capitalization should change the meaning of a command, and even
if it did, speech recognition would not be able to understand it.

So, <n,N>o <M,m>ore <o,O>f <t,T>his. It is by far the ugliest and most
un needed part of dictionaries.

------------------------------------------
For now I will just write what comes to mind as improvements for the
dictionary syntax. I will worry about structuring this later.
